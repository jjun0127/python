        while True:
            line = (yield)
            if pattern in line:
                print line,

    g = grep("python")
    # Notice how you don't need a next() call here
    g.send("Yeah, but no, but yeah, but no")
    g.send("A series of tubes")
    g.send("python generators rock!")
```
